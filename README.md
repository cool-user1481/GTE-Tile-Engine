# GTE (GTE Tile Engine)
>Recursive initialisms are funni
##### A semi-simple game engine for games using a tile-based world. Active work in progress.
Oopsie, I forgot to making when I made this repo, I promise the 13 fps will be fixed<br>
update: :D I did it! It now gets about 60 fps all the time! The engine and examples will most likely be cleaned up and published before Jan 6 or 7 (I hope). Update 2: It 100% will not :(. I realized there is a ton more stuff to do :(. Sometime in 202-6 or 7 will it most likely come out.
